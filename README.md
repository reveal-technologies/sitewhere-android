# **DEPRECATED** SiteWhere Android Libraries

This repository contains the old SiteWhere Android SDK that was only
compatible with ADT. The new **sitewhere/sitewhere-android-sdk** 
repository contains artifacts that are compatible with Android Studio.
All new development is done in the other repository.
